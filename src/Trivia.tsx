            In my free time, I love to play musical instruments. I mostly play
            electric guitar, but I also can play acoustic guitar, bass, and
            piano at a basic level. Playing music helps me relieve stress.
            Therefore, I always have at least an electric guitar with me
            whenever I relocate to a city. Rather than exercising a specific
            song (I am lazy and not good at memorising something…), I love to
            improvise over diverse backing tracks available on YouTube. I also
            have basic songwriting skills, so I write my own songs sometimes.

        Jeju Island is a beautiful place where I was born and grew up until my
        early twenties. Then, I was in Hong Kong and the UK for my master and
        PhD degrees, respectively. During my postdoc, I was in Singapore. Of
        course, I have chances to live in non-island cities as well. When I
        spent three months in New York for an internship, however, I was in
        Manhattan (which is an island). When I worked in Berlin after finishing
        my PhD, my office was on the Museum island.

            hotel in Hell, a small town right next to Trondheim Airport, and
            rebooked my flight for 30th June, Monday.
